# Shell File Converters 🛠️
A collection of file conversion wrappers with obvious names.

Stop using sites like https://png2ico.com, https://pdf2png.com, etc. You've always been able to do this in your terminal.
Only this time you won't have to memorize any of the commands!

### Usage

Convert single png image to ico
```sh
png2ico image1.png
```

Convert all png files in current dir to JPG (does not affect original files)
```sh
png2jpg *.png
```

Convert document to image
```sh
pdf2png document.pdf
```

... and so on, see [generator.py](generator.py)

## Installation 🚀

As simple as adding this line to your bashrc:

```bash
source /path/to/shell_file_converters.sh
```
